Updated Analysis:
From index.mm
Please analyse how 
1. generate views, controllers and menus or use any  of jinda
2. Search for all code to understand how each of step 1 know about permission using value from index.mm. The code are in ./lib/jinda

From understanding of 1. and 2. 
now should understand the need of functions to create require tasks for 1. and 2. in index.mm that current create by mindmap, now must be create or update by new javascript: jinda_mindmap
jinda_mindmap is name of this project to create internal mindmap module to create index.mm which include
a. the following view as mindmap as attached in ~/mygem/todo/jinda.png that sync with index.mm and can be read using the code in ./lib/jinda directory
Then write up the flow that the code read from jinda.png which will be the flow to re-generate new javascript for create mongodb 1. model document about tables and fields like person, address, article  2. services for each model which will be views and controllers 3. roles: admin, members and anything like developer

we will need the details plan on ths flow before design the next step
Let focus on step a to have all detail before really create it later
